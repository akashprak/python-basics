    "#### 1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "- Python's OOP helps in bringing data and functions together in a class and restricts its access from outside the class.\n",
    "- It implements inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation etc.\n",
    "- Python OOP's classes create the blueprint upon which further modifications can be made through inheritance, hence making the program memory efficient.\n",
    "- classes and objects make for the better understanding of the code's operations\n",
    "- modifications can be made to the program without disturbing other functions"

    "#### Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",

    "- instance level\n",
    "- class level of the instance class\n",
    "- super classes  \n",
    "\n",
    "The search in the super classes follows the Method Resolution Order."

    "#### Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "- In python **Object** is the super class of all classes, so class itself is an instance of object.\n",
    "- we can create any number of instances for classes in python, which is called objects, so the terms instance and object can be used interchangeably.\n",
    "- classes are only created once from which any number of objects are instantiated.\n",
    "- we can access only class attrubutes and methods from the class level but instances can access both class and instance level attributes and methods."

    "**Ans**:\n",
    "- The first argument for a classmethod is `cls`, which references the class itself. This method is used to deploy class level operations like mass instantiation.\n",
    "- The first argument for instance methods is `self` which refernces the object. This is used to deploy instance level operations which is unique for each instance. "
