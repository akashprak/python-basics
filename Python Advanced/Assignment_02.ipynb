    "#### 1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "**Ans**:\n",
    "- In python, classes are blueprints to create objects. Classes bundle together attributes and methods and restrict their access from outside the class.  \n",
    "classes are used to segregate different types or parts of the code.\n",
    "- modules are simply any `.py` file which can be imported from any other python file. modules behave similar to classes in segregating the code and bundling related scripts."

    "**Ans**: class attributes should be created right after defining the class and writing the docstring.  \n",

    "Class attributes can also be created like:\n",
