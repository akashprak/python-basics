    "#### 1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "**Ans**: Probability distribution describes the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment.  \n",
    "Based on the likelihood of the previous data, it can predict the probability of occurence of a value.\n"

    "**Ans**: Pseudo-random numbers are numbers which are generated by some deterministic process but they qualify the statistical test for randomness. They may be generated by using a truly random number.  \n",
    "The latter is considered good enough because for most applications it is statistically significant."
